	   <h2>Dani Alves' best moments after his return to Barcelona five years later</h2>
	   <h5>12-December-2021&nbsp;</h5>
		 <p>Dani Alves has returned. Despite the fact that he is not eligible to play for Barcelona in official competition until January, the Brazilian right-back was able to play 90 minutes in Barcelona's Maradona Cup encounter against Boca Juniors in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday night.</p>
		 <p>The 38-year-old had one of the game's first touches and was heavily involved, drifting centrally from his right-hand position.</p>
		 <p>He got one of the first chances of the game, volleying following a beautiful ball from Riqui Puig to the Brazilian.</p>

		 <p>After a 1-1 draw thanks to goals from Ferran Jutgla and Exequiel Zeballos, the Maradona Cup was won on penalties, with Barcelona's Dani Alves taking the first kick. While wearing the captain's armband, he scored his penalty, although it was near to being saved, and he knew it, making a gesture shortly afterward about how it was "this close" to missing.</p>
		 <p>Dani Alves' return to the pitch was not a successful one, as Boca Juniors triumphed 4-2 in the shootout.</p>
		 <p>After a five-and-a-half-year absence, Dani Alves has rejoined Barcelona.
His final match for Barcelona was a 2-0 triumph against his previous club Sevilla in the 2015/16 Copa del Rey final. That was five years, six months, and twenty-two days ago, on May 22, 2016.</p>
